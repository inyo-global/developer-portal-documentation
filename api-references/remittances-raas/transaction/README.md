# Transaction

Once you have the sender, funding account, and recipient details, you can continue to create a transaction. In general, the transactions created are transactions that are sent from a sender in Inyo to an external recipient. Every transaction has two different flows: transaction processing(Debit) and delivery(Credit). The statuses of these two flows are different (transaction status and delivery status) and updates on changes will be shared through webhooks.

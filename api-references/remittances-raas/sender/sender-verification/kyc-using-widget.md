# KYC Using Widget

In order to use widget v1.0 for KYC, please follow the guidelines [here](../../widget/widget-v1.0/). You will have to specify widget type as `kyc`. Once users have submitted the required information, you can review widget events and KYC events to learn about the KYC status of the user.

# Expired ID Documents

A user must submit a VALID ID document in order for the ID document to be verified. If the user's ID document expires, the user will not be verified for the transaction limit and tier for which the ID is required.

If a user's ID document is expiring within 15 days, you will receive ['`sender_document_expiring_soon`' webhook](../../../webhooks/events.md) once which you can use to notify the user. When the latest ID document of a user expires, you will receive[ '`sender_document_expired`' webhook](../../../webhooks/events.md) and '`document.expiry_status`' will be `EXPIRED` when you fetch ID document details via our API. Once the ID document expires, the KYC status/tier of the sender may change based on the sender's tier before ID expires AND your CIP requirement for ID. The matrix below provides details on how the sender will be affected and the next steps need to be taken to collect ID of the user.

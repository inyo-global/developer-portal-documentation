# Funding Account

The sender can add either bank account or link debit cards to fund their transactions. These are collectively called funding accounts. Sensitive information such as bank and card number will not be shared, will be encrypted and stored and will only be used for actual payment processing. However, you should store funding account IDs and information for further operations such as Create Transaction, Remove Funding Account etc.
